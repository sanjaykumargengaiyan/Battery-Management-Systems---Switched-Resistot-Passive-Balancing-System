The goal is to hand-tune a resistance value to use in a switched-resistor passive balancing system. If this 
resistance is too low, balancing power dissipated by the resistor will be high, resulting in the need for larger 
(and more expensive) resistor and transistor components. Further, the total heat generated by all balancers in the 
pack will be high, resulting in a need for a bigger (and more expensive)thermal-management system. But, balancing 
will be fast. On the other hand, if the resistance is too high, balancing will be slow. So, there is a design tradeoff 
that must be satisfied when choosing the balancing resistance.

This code consists of dataset representing an out-of-balance battery pack that you will use to test your balancing design. 
This dataset is from simulation of more than 200h of real time on a 100-cell battery pack having mismatched cells. 
This represents more than 3,000 miles (around 5,000 km) of vehicle driving plus multiple battery-pack charging events --
all without balancing! So, if we are able to balance this battery pack in less than 36h, we are doing well enough.

I have provided code to you that loads this dataset, and is able to execute up to 36h of balancing on the dataset if you 
provide a balancing-resistance value. The balancing strategy is based on cell terminal voltage -- cells are "balanced"
whenever their terminal voltage is more than 2mV greater than the minimum terminal voltage of all 100 cells in the battery pack.
